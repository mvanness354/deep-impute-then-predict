# In Defense of Zero Imputation for Tabular Deep Learning

Code to reproduce our experiments can be found in the `run_scripts/` directory. To install dependencies, we encourage users to set up two different environments, one for tensorflow (for everything except GNNs) and one for PyTorch (for GNNs). The corresponding dependencies can be found in `requirements_tf.txt` and `requirements_torch.txt` respectively.
